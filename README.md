# Animap

Animap is project to log animals in a simple fashion similar to the Pokedex, a commonly used device in the Pokemon series. The goal is to provide information as quickly as possible. Ideally this would give critical information to someone who encounters an animal, i.e., how dangerous the animal is, how to avoid the animal, etc.
